                 At Jerne IF, we’re more than a sports club — we’re a community. Our supporters are the lifeblood of everything we do. With “Dead Pigeons,” you can now help power our club in a fun, engaging way, all while potentially winning weekly prizes.
                 <br /><br />
                 Here’s how it works: each week, we draw three winning numbers and compare them to the sequences on the boards you’ve purchased. You choose 5–8 numbers (from 1 to 16) on each board, and every matching sequence could land you a piece of the prize pool. Seventy percent of all board sales goes back to the winners — the remaining 30 % supports Jerne IF.
                 <br /><br />
                 Getting started is easy:
                 <br /><br />
                 * Apply for membership at one of our clubs.
                 * Create a balance in your account (you can top-up via MobilePay — just include your transaction number for us to verify).
                 * Buy as many boards as you like, for as many weeks as you want — and even reuse the same board week after week.
                 * Join the game before <b>Saturday at 17:00</b> (local Danish time), and once the winning numbers are in, the next round begins automatically.
                 <br /><br />
                 Our admins oversee everything — they have full visibility into registered players, transactions, and game history. They also manually calculate and distribute prizes in coordination with physical players, ensuring fairness for everyone.
                 <br /><br />
                 Whether you’re here to support your club, take part in something fun, or try your luck — welcome aboard. Play smart, play often — and thank you for helping Jerne IF thrive!
